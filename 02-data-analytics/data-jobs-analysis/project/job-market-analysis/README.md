# India Data Jobs Market Analysis

## Executive Summary

This project investigates the structure of India's data-jobs market using 51,088 job postings from
the 2023 Data Jobs dataset. The analysis addresses five connected questions — market structure,
skill demand, skill evolution, compensation evidence, and Data Analyst skill strategy — across five
notebooks with a pinned dataset revision.

### Market Structure

India contributes 6.5% of global postings. Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Data Analyst roles
account for **75.3%** of India postings.

Bengaluru is the largest named job-posting location at **22.5%** of India postings. However, generic
`India` and `Anywhere` labels cover a substantial share of demand, making location precision
imperfect.

![Location concentration — share of India postings by location label](figures/01_location_concentration.png)

The ten most active employers contribute only **5.8%** of postings (Employer HHI ≈ 9), confirming
that demand is highly fragmented across the employer base. The results show geographic concentration
in visible postings without comparable concentration among employers.

### Skill Architecture

SQL and Python form the shared technical foundation across the three largest role families.
Role-specific stacks diverge clearly beyond this core.

The skills with the largest prevalence spread across roles provide the clearest signal of role
specialisation.

![Role differentiators — prevalence spread by skill and leading role](figures/02_role_differentiators.png)

Advertised skill demand is structured around recurring skill bundles rather than isolated tools.
Python and SQL appear together in **41.1%** of India data-job postings.

### Skill Evolution

The established skill mix remained broadly stable during 2023. Among skills reaching at least 3%
prevalence in either half, PyTorch recorded the largest positive movement at **+1.5 percentage
points**, while Spark recorded the largest decline at **−3.3 points**.

![Half-year skill prevalence changes among established skills](figures/03_halfyear_skill_changes.png)

Month-to-month volatility was common but did not translate into a structural reordering of the skill
hierarchy. Core technologies maintained their relative positions throughout the year.

### Compensation Evidence

Only **582 India postings (1.1%)** disclose annual salary. No role has enough coverage to support
market-representative salary benchmarks.

![Salary disclosure coverage by role](figures/04_salary_coverage_by_role.png)

The disclosed subset overrepresents some role families and underrepresents others, creating
selection bias that limits cross-role comparisons.

Within the disclosed subset, technical and senior roles lead on median salary. All figures are
presented with sample sizes and interquartile ranges.

### Data Analyst Skill Strategy

For Data Analyst roles specifically, SQL offers the broadest market reach and the strongest salary
evidence base. Power BI and Tableau occupy higher pay-signal positions on the Pareto frontier with
meaningful but narrower reach.

![Data Analyst Pareto frontier — reach vs pay signal](figures/05_analyst_skill_pareto.png)

The reach ranking across all established analyst skills confirms SQL and Python as the dominant
access tools, followed by Excel and the BI platforms.

Evidence quality varies significantly across skills. Every salary comparison should be read
alongside the salary record count.

## Analytical Objective

The analysis answers five connected questions:

1. How is advertised data-job demand structured across roles, locations, and employers?
2. Which skills provide broad market access, and which distinguish specific role families?
3. Did Data Analyst skill demand materially change during 2023?
4. What compensation comparisons are defensible given the available salary evidence?
5. Which Data Analyst skills offer the strongest trade-offs between market reach, pay signal, and
   evidence quality?

The project treats a posting as a signal of advertised demand, not as a completed hire. Metrics are
designed around prevalence, concentration, change, coverage, and sample strength rather than raw
counts alone.

- **License:** see the [third-party notices](../../../../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
- **Dataset revision:** `1d815e9ce232eb27db11939c44eb048fe6d2e9ab`

The dataset contains job postings from calendar year 2023. The notebooks pin the revision above so
the analytical input is stable across reruns. Important limitations:

- Posting volume is not equivalent to hires or unique vacancies.
- Duplicate or syndicated listings may inflate demand.
- Skill mentions do not measure proficiency requirements.
- Employer and location labels are not fully standardised.
- Salary is missing for **98.9%** of India postings and may be missing systematically.
- Salary values are standardised annual USD figures and may not reflect local compensation
  structures precisely.
- The analysis does not establish current market conditions or causal salary premiums.
