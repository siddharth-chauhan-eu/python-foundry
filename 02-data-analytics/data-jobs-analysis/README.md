# Data Jobs Analysis

Applied data analytics using 2023 data-job postings, with Germany as the main working market.

Exercises build the data-oriented Python patterns needed before touching a DataFrame. Notebooks
apply those skills progressively — from library fundamentals through demand analysis, trend
tracking, and compensation investigation. The project applies the same methodology in a structured
five-notebook study of the Indian market.

## Exercises

| #   | File                     | Concepts                                                                |

| 01  | `01_job_role_matcher.py` | Lists · dicts · for loops · `all()` · membership testing · `str.join()` |
| 02  | `02_job_data_cleanup.py` | `datetime` parsing · `ast.literal_eval()` · dicts · in-place mutation   |

**01 — Job Role Matcher.** Matches a current skill set against predefined role requirements. Each
role specifies required skills as a list; the script uses `all()` with a generator to test subset
membership in a single readable expression — the same pattern used in every filtering step
downstream.

**02 — Job Data Cleanup.** Converts string-encoded job records into typed Python objects. Skill
strings are parsed with `ast.literal_eval()` and date strings are converted with
`datetime.strptime()`. This is exactly the parsing logic that appears at the top of every subsequent
notebook.

## Notebooks

All notebooks use the
[Luke Barousse Data Jobs dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs) and are
scoped to Germany unless stated otherwise.

### 01 — Pandas Basics

Introduces the data loading, cleanup, and aggregation workflow used throughout the module. Covers
datetime conversion, country-based filtering, and `groupby` salary statistics by job title. No chart
is produced; the focus is understanding the dataset before visualising it.

### 02 — Matplotlib Basics

Produces the first visualisation from the dataset: a horizontal bar chart of median salary by job
title across all global postings.

### 03 — Job Demand Analysis

Identifies the most advertised data roles in Germany and maps how job-posting volume changes across
the calendar year.

**Key findings:**

- Data Analyst was the most frequently advertised role, with more than 7,000 postings
- Data Scientist and Data Engineer followed closely, confirming broad demand across all three core
  functions
- Job-posting volume declined mid-year and reached its lowest point in May
- October recorded the highest job-posting activity of the year

### 04 — Trending Skills Analysis

Counts skill mentions across Data Engineer postings, tracks monthly demand for each skill, and
renders a heatmap for the five most frequently requested skills.

**Key findings:**

- Python appeared in 3,524 postings — the most of any single skill
- SQL matched Python's demand throughout the year, confirming its foundational role
- Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS) were consistently requested across all twelve months

### 05 — Skill Pay Analysis

Compares compensation evidence with demand evidence for Data Engineer skills in Germany. Salary data
is sparse (39 records); all findings are treated as directional signals rather than market
benchmarks.

**Key findings:**

- GitHub and MATLAB were associated with the highest disclosed median salaries (~$200K), but each
  appears in very few postings
- The highest-paying skills are not the most frequently requested, revealing a clear reach vs. pay
  trade-off
- Python, SQL, cloud platforms, and orchestration tools score well across both dimensions

## Project

### Job Market Analysis

A structured multi-notebook study of India's data-job market using the same dataset. Covers market
structure, skill architecture, skill evolution, salary analysis, and a Pareto frontier analysis of
Data Analyst skill strategy.

## Data Source

[Luke Barousse Data Jobs dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs) — job
postings from calendar year 2023.

- Upstream license: Apache-2.0
- Dataset revision: `1d815e9ce232eb27db11939c44eb048fe6d2e9ab`
- `data_jobs.csv` SHA-256: `635241ed09ccee18bdae1f83b45f26d6759e0aa2513c529f6190e9054062436c`

The notebooks pin the Hugging Face dataset revision so the analytical input does not silently change
when upstream `main` changes. The dataset itself is not redistributed in this repository.

## Environment setup

Run the setup command from the repository root:

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

Use the repository's `.venv` as the notebook kernel. See the
[root setup instructions](../../README.md#supported-setup).
