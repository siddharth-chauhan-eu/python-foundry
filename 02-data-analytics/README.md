# 02 — Data Analytics

From DataFrame basics to evidence-aware analysis using real-world job-posting data.

This module builds applied data analytics capability in a single coherent arc — exercises establish
Python patterns for structured data, notebooks develop library skills and apply them to Germany's
data-job market, and a project extends the methodology into a structured five-notebook study of
India.

## Dataset

The notebooks and project use the
[Luke Barousse Data Jobs dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs) — a
collection of data-role job postings from calendar year 2023, covering multiple countries and role
types. The pure-Python exercises use small in-repository examples rather than the external dataset.

## Environment setup

Run the setup command from the repository root:

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

Use the repository's `.venv` as the notebook kernel. See the
[root setup instructions](../README.md#supported-setup).

See [`data-jobs-analysis/README.md`](data-jobs-analysis/README.md) for full documentation.
